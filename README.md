## MQTT Fullstack Code Challenge

This is a personal project created to solve a code challenge based on the following stack:
* Node
* React
* MQTT

This application simply shows a table with a list of devices and their status. On the other hand there is a node script running simulating the devices by sending messages to a mqtt broker.

### How to run: development

In order to run this application in development mode (The only one supported right now) you just need to clone the repo and run:
```
npm install
npm run dev
```
